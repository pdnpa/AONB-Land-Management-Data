# AONB-Land-Management-Data
A repo to include data for Land Management Schemes in AONBs cut by PDNPA

This is a reproducible data dictionary based on a python script to scrape Natural England open data in order to perform analysis for AONB areas. As this is a script, it can be re-run as and when the data is updated through ESRI ARCGIS. Moreover, this analysis is reproducible meaning this analysis can be copied or investigated and improved on.
